# Polar Drones Field of Vision Calculations

## There are 3 different solutions included (really just one right now)

- First is an easy to understand, but unnacceptably slow solution that is O(n^2) on this [branch](https://github.com/benracine/drones-polar/tree/naive-On2)
- Then there is an O(n * log n ) solution on a TBD branch.
- And lastly, an O(n) solution on a TBD branch.

## Quick Start

This can be run with a simple `cargo run`

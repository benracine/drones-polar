# Polar Drones Field of Vision Calculations

## There are 2 different solutions

- First is an easy to understand, but probably unnacceptably slow solution that is O(n^2) on this [branch](https://github.com/benracine/drones-polar/tree/naive-On2)
- Then there is an O(n * log n ) solution on this [branch](https://github.com/benracine/drones-polar/tree/n-log-n).

## Quick Start

All branches can be run with a simple `cargo run` from the project root.
